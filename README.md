# Advent of Code 2021

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) for the problem specs.

Aims in the approach:
 - Use python 3.10 and explore a few of the newer features, e.g. pattern matching.
 - Use the [pipe](https://pypi.org/project/pipe/) library, because I only found that recently and it looks useful.
 - Don't use lots of other libraries, but remember how to use core python :)
 - Make it readable.
